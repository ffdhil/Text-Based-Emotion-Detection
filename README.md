# Text-Based-Emotion-Detection

**Description:**
This repository encompasses the code and resources for my project on "Text-Based Emotion Detection," as well as the accompanying research paper that has been successfully published.

**Overview:**
- 💬 **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and effective system for detecting emotions expressed in text data. Emotion detection in text is a critical component of natural language processing and has applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and human-computer interaction.

- 📝 **Research Paper:** This project are pleased to share the published research paper that presents the project's methodology, experimental results, and insights. The paper is titled "Emotion Detection in Text Using CNN" and "Text-Based Emotion Detection using CNN-BiLSTM", and it offers a comprehensive exploration of the emotion detection model.

- 📁 **Dataset:** This project used a dataset containing comments about CommuterLine and Transjakarta. The dataset divided into 3 types: CommuterLine, Transjakarta, and combionation of both.

- 🤖 **Model:** This pproject implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and CNN + BiLSTM architecture and combined it with Word Embedding Glove and Word2Vec tailored for text analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in capturing emotional cues from textual data.

- 📊 **Performance:** The project provides an extensive analysis of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, showcasing its ability to accurately classify emotions in text.

- 📄 **Code:** This repository contains the Python code used for data preprocessing, model training, and emotion detection on new text inputs. The code is accessible for those interested in reproducing the experiments or further extending the project.
